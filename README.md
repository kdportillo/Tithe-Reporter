# Tithe-Reporter
A GUI for summarizing yearly tithe donations for tax purposes. 

## Timeline
- Console: given a sample dataset, export all tuples to PDFs
- GUI: open a gui where the user can select the dataset, then export all/selected tuples
- .exe: make a complete program that can run cross platform

## Notes
- Final document must include two lines for human signatures 
- GUIs should include a preview of the dataset and a preview of the export before user exports
